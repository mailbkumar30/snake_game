Here's what's new in the game, added into second comit:
The snake can now pass through walls and appear on the opposite side
The game is slower:
Initial speed reduced from 10 to 6
Maximum speed reduced from 20 to 12
Speed increases more gradually (every 10 points instead of 5)
Added different types of fruits with varying points:
Apple (red) - 1 point
Banana (yellow) - 2 points
Orange - 3 points
Blueberry (blue) - 4 points
Grape (purple) - 5 points
Special golden fruits still appear and double the points!
Updated the game title to "Snake & Fruits - A Tasty Adventure"
You can now play the game with these new features. The snake will move more slowly and smoothly, and you'll have different fruits to collect with varying point values. When you hit a wall, you'll come out the other side, making the game more forgiving and fun!
